# Simple Discord Rich Presence

This script requires almost no setup from you.

In the configuration file, you’ll find a `DiscordAppId` field — make sure to replace it with your own Discord Application ID, which you can create or find here: [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

At the bottom of the config, there is a `Locale` setting, which is set to `"en"` by default. Change it to your country’s locale code to localize the text accordingly.

If you have any questions or want to join the community, feel free to join our Discord server: [discord.gg/BuJdBcrkyb](https://discord.gg/BuJdBcrkyb)
